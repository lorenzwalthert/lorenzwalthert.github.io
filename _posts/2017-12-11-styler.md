title: "styler - A non-invasive source code formatter for R"
description: styler is a flexible source code fromatter that makes styling 
  files, packages or entire R source trees a breeze. The style guide implemented
  is the tidyverse style guide, but third party style guides are supported.
  I got involved in the development of it through Google Summer of Code 2017.

I am pleased to announce that the R package 
[styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler), which I have worked on 
through [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/gsoc2017/)
with [Kirill Müller](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) and [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui),
has reached a mature stage.


You can now install it from CRAN


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("styler")
{% endhighlight %}

If your CRAN mirror does not yet have it, you can get it from GitHub with `remotes::install_github("r-lib/styler")`.

The package formats R code, by default according to the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
The distinguishing feature of styler is its flexibility. We will introduce some
of the options below. Before I continue, I want to thank my two mentors 
from Google Summer of Code, in particular 
[Kirill Müller](https://twitter.com/krlmlr), who was an amazing 
companion during the three months of coding - and beyond. I feel really blessed 
how everything came about. In addition, I would like to thank Google for 
organizing GSOC this year and facilitating the involvement of students in open 
source projects. 

Back to the package: `styler` can style text, single files, packages and entire
R source trees with the following functions:

* `style_text()` styles a character vector.
* `style_file()` styles R and Rmd files.
* `style_dir()` styles all R and/or Rmd files in a directory.
* `style_pkg()` styles the source files of an R package.
* An RStudio Addin that styles the active file R or Rmd file, the current 
  package or the highlighted code.

# Styling options
We can limit ourselves to styling just spacing information by indicating this 
with the `scope` argument:


{% highlight r %}
library("styler")
library("magrittr")
style_text("a=3; 2", scope = "spaces")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
a = 3; 2
{% endhighlight %}

If you are reading this post on r-bloggers, there might be issues with 
displaying code and rendered output correctly. You can continue reading on 
the page this post was published [initially](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/stylerpost/).

Or, on the other extreme of the scale, styling spaces, indention, line breaks 
and tokens:


{% highlight r %}
style_text("a=3; 2", scope = "tokens")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
a <- 3
2
{% endhighlight %}

Another option that is helpful to determine the level of 'invasiveness' is
`strict`. If set to `TRUE`, spaces and line breaks before or after tokens are
set to either zero or one. However, in some situations this might be 
undesirable (so we set `strict = FALSE`), as the following example shows:


{% highlight r %}
style_text(
  "data_frame(
     small  = 2 ,
     medium = 4,#comment without space
     large  =6
   )", strict = FALSE
)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
data_frame(
  small  = 2,
  medium = 4, # comment without space
  large  = 6
)
{% endhighlight %}

We prefer to keep the equal sign after "small", "medium" and large aligned,
so we set `strict = FALSE` to set spacing to *at least* one around `=`.

Though simple, hopefully the above examples convey some of the flexibility of 
the configuration options available in `styler`.  You can find out more about
options available with the tidyverse style by checking out the help file for
`style_tidyverse()`. 

# Gallery 

In the sequel, let us focus on a configuration with 
`strict = TRUE` and `scope = "tokens"` and illustrate a few more examples of 
code before and after styling.

`styler` can identify and handle unary operators and other math tokens:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
1++1-1-1/2
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
1 + +1 - 1 - 1 / 2
{% endhighlight %}

This is tidyverse style. However, styler offers very granular control for 
math token spacing. Assuming you like spacing around `+` and `-`, but not 
around `/` and `*` and `^`. This can be achieved as follows:

{% highlight r %}
style_text(
  "1++1/2*2^2", 
  math_token_spacing = specify_math_token_spacing(zero = c("'/'", "'*'", "'^'"))
)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
1 + +1/2*2^2
{% endhighlight %}

It can also format complicated expressions that involve line breaking and 
indention based on both brace expressions and operators:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
if (x >3) {stop("this is an error")} else {
c(there_are_fairly_long,
1 / 33 * 
2 * long_long_variable_names)%>% k(

) }
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
if (x > 3) {
  stop("this is an error")
} else {
  c(
    there_are_fairly_long,
    1 / 33 *
      2 * long_long_variable_names
  ) %>% k()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Lines are broken after `(` if a function call spans multiple lines:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
do_a_long_and_complicated_fun_cal("which", has, way, to, 
                              "and longer then lorem ipsum in its full length"
                              )
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
do_a_long_and_complicated_fun_cal(
  "which", has, way, to,
  "and longer then lorem ipsum in its full length"
)
{% endhighlight %}

`styler` replaces `=` with `<-` for assignment, handles single quotes within 
strings if necessary, and adds braces to function calls in pipes:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
one= 'one string'
two= "one string in a 'string'"
a %>%
  b %>%
  c
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
one <- "one string"
two <- "one string in a 'string'"
a %>%
  b() %>%
  c()
{% endhighlight %}

Function declarations are indented if multi-line:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
my_fun <- function(x, 
y, 
z) {
  just(z)
}
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
my_fun <- function(x,
                   y,
                   z) {
  just(z)
}
{% endhighlight %}

`styler` can also deal with tidyeval syntax:


{% highlight styler %}
# Before
mtcars %>%
  group_by(!!!my_vars)
{% endhighlight %}




{% highlight text %}
# After
mtcars %>%
  group_by(!!! my_vars)
{% endhighlight %}



If you, say, don't want comments starting with `###` to be indented, you can 
formulate an unindention rule:

{% highlight r %}
style_text(
  c(
    "a <- function() {",
    "### not to be indented",
    "# indent normally",
    "33",
    "}"
  ),
  reindention = specify_reindention(regex_pattern = "###", indention = 0)
  
)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
a <- function() {
### not to be indented
  # indent normally
  33
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Customizing styler - implementing your own style guide

Not only can you customize styler with the options of `tidyverse_style()`. The 
real flexibility of `styler` is supporting third-party style
guides. Technically speaking, a style guide such as `tidyverse_style()` is 
nothing but a set of transformer functions and options. How you can create
your own style guide is explained in [this](http://styler.r-lib.org/articles/customizing_styler.html) 
vignette.

# Wrap-up

I hope I have convinced you that you should give `styler` a try. If you find 
unexpected behavior, you are welcome to file an issue on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/issues).
