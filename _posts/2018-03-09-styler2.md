[styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) 1.0.1 is now available on CRAN. It's
mainly a maintenance release and contains bug fixes and speed improvements.
The highlights are:

* Require tibble `v1.4.2` which was optimized for speed, so if you have it 
  installed, styler runs ~2x as fast as before.
* We're now recognizing and respecting more DSLs used in R comments: rplumber 
  (`#*`), shebang (`#/!`) and knitr chunk headers for spinning (`#+` / 
  `#-`).
* Code chunks in Rmd documents that don't use the R engine are no longer 
  formatted.
* Rule adaptations related to changes in the tidyverse style guide and 
  rlang 0.2.0.
* Removed an annoying implicit `dplyr` dependency.
  
For details, you can have a look at the 
[release notes](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/releases/tag/v1.0.1) or check
out [all Pull Requests that were merged into master since the last release](https://github.com/r-lib/styler/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+created%3A%3E2017-12-11+),
which contains the majority of the bug fixes, as only few were comitted directly
to master.

We thank all people who have contributed to this release in one way or another.
