title: "oneliner - a new style guide for styler"
description: styler is a flexible source code fromatter that makes styling 
  files, packages or entire R source trees a breeze. This blog post introduces
  a third-party style guide called oneliner that can be used in conjunction 
  with styler to format code.

I am happy to introduce [oneliner](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/oneliner), a package that implements the *one-line-style* as a third-party style guide ready to use with [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler). Hence, after the tidyverse style guide, this is the first third-party style guide for styler I am aware of - and a particularly useful one.

Let’s see an example

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("lorenzwalthert/oneliner")
library(oneliner)
style_text(
  "sum <- function(x, y) {
   x + # hi
   y
  }
  1 + 1",
  style = one_line_style
)
```

As you can guess from the name and the code above, the style guide has three rules only: 

* Remove all comments.
* Remove all spaces possible (almost all).
* Put all code on one line.

Compared to the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org), which contains 37 sections organized in seven chapters (with each section typically containing multiple rules), *one-line-style* is a great simplification to say the least. Further advantages of the style guide proposed include:

  - Entirely self-explanatory (probably biggest plus).
  - It ends the tabs / spaces indention war in an unexpected and elegant
    way.
  - You don’t need to worry about EOL markers.
  - You can easily export to csv. One command per column.
  - People (including you) can't read your code and think you are a genius.
  - and so on.

I am sure I have convinced you that this style guide rocks. This is for
real programmers. All code on one line. No spaces or comments. I am
serious. Use this style guide to format your code like nerds do. Or if you quit a company and you want to give your team mates a little challenge. 

As a final note, be aware that you can always use the tidyverse style guide on code that was styled according to *one-line-style* because the AST should not be changed with *one-line-style*.
```{r}
library("styler")
style_text("sum<-function(x,y){x+y};1+1", style = tidyverse_style)
```
